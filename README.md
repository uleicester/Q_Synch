# Q_Synch

The data repository can be obtained by following the link https://figshare.com/articles/software/CodeAndData/14478132


Tthere are 4 zip files.


QSynchBenchmark.zip contains the source files needed to execture the benchmarkFSM.

QSynchRandom.zip contains the source files needed to execute the randomly generated FSMs.

In BruteForceResetSequence.zip we provided the implementation of the parallel algorithm.

In EppsteinGreedy.zip we provided the implementation of the Greedy Algorithm

PLEASE NOTE
Codes were compiled under Microsoft Visual studio 2012.

For each project you have to enter the data file name and the output file name in the main.cpp. Source.cpp and kernel.cu files.

kernel.cu was compiled in CUDA 6 under compute capability 2.1
